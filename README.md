Project: Jewelry Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Objective:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict optimal jewelry prices for Gemineye Emporium, an expanding jewelry dealer. This will help the company streamline its pricing process, reduce reliance on expensive gemologists, and improve operational efficiency.

Methodology:

Data Understanding (EDA):

Loaded and explored the jewelry dataset.
Analyzed data properties: missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, low cardinality, data imbalance, and feature correlations.
Identified and addressed data quality issues.
Data Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data:
Handled missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Removed irrelevant features (e.g., "SKU_Quantity").
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., "Category", "Main_Metal", "Main_Gem", Main_Color).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Development:

Selected and trained appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Catboost, linear regression, decision trees, random forests).
Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Selection and Fine-tuning:

Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Deployment and Monitoring:

Deployed the trained model for real-time price predictions.
Continuously monitored model performance and retrained as needed to adapt to changing market conditions.
Key Findings:

Significant data quality issues were identified and addressed.
Feature engineering and selection played a crucial role in model performance.
The chosen machine learning model demonstrated promising results in predicting jewelry prices.
Future Work:

Explore more advanced machine learning models (e.g., deep learning, ensemble methods).
Incorporate external data sources (e.g., market trends, competitor pricing) to improve predictions.
Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
